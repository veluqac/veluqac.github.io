We’re excited to welcome a new team member to the Veluqac project: [Thomas Bissonnette-Royer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomas-bissonnette-royer-27510b1b0), a computer engineering undergraduate student at [UQAC](https://www.uqac.ca). Curious, dedicated, and passionate about technological innovation, Thomas joins the project to contribute to the development of both the hardware and software behind our electricity-generating bike-desk platform.

For Thomas, this adventure is much more than an opportunity to apply what he’s learned: it’s a **chance to grow and learn** in a hands-on, stimulating environment. He will begin by conducting a review of existing solutions, identifying best practices, and making sure to build on solid foundations rather than reinvent the wheel.

Next, he’ll take part in a key phase of the project: designing the very first **functional prototype** of the bike-desk. This prototype will need to be conceived as a modular platform, adaptable to a variety of use cases and experimental contexts.

To support his involvement, Thomas will receive **student scholarships**, a boost that reinforces the project’s educational mission and supports his academic development.

Welcome to the team, Thomas! We’re thrilled to have you on board as we pedal together toward more active, greener, and better-connected campuses.
