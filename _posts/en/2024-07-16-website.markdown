We are excited to announce the official launch of the **Veluqac** website!

Designed to be simple, functional, and easy to access, this site is hosted via [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com), and its source code, based on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) technology, is entirely open on a public [repository](https://github.com/veluqac/veluqac.github.io). This allows for total transparency and offers the community the opportunity to **contribute** and follow the technical evolution of the project.

This site will be the main communication channel to share key information about the project. Whether you are a student, a researcher, or simply curious, you will find articles detailing the development of prototypes, an overview of the technologies we use, as well as portraits of the team behind Veluqac.

**Veluqac** is a multidisciplinary research project, launched at the Université du Québec à Chicoutimi ([UQAC](https://www.uqac.ca)). It is part of an innovation approach focused on **education**, **sustainable development**, and **health**, with the objective of designing and studying a bike-desk platform generating electricity.
