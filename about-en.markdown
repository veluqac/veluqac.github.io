Veluqac is a multidisciplinary project, designed by and for the university community from [UQAC](https://www.uqac.ca), aimed at developing and studying the use of an electricity-generating bike-desk platform.

This project aims, among other things, to raise awareness among users about energy consumption, to combat a sedentary lifestyle and to introduce new educational approaches and techniques.
